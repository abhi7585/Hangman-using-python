# Hangman-using-python
User attempts to build a missing word by guessing one letter at a time. After a certain number of incorrect guesses, the game ends and the player loses. If the player correctly identifies all the letters of the missing word, then points are given, and a new word is given if the user continues to play.

In this project, I have created Hangman game using a list which contains all the words (Words can be added in the list).
The user is given a word in * format of the length of the word. Then the user is asked to guess the character if the user guess is correct then the * is replaced with the character.
Game is ended when the user's chances are 0 which is deducted when the user fails to guess the character. The game can also end when the user guessed the word correctly but is not willing to play further.
In the end, point and name are shown.
